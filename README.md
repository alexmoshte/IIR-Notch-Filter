# IIR-Notch-filter
Here I design, simulate and develop digital IIR notch filters for a STM32G4 MCU to attenuate 50Hz power line interference from the mains. The filter is intended for a multichannel biosignal acquisition board I designed in flux. The article provided in this repo also outlines the design flow I adopted to design the filters and can be used to design, simulate and develop other types of digital IIR filters. The header files, .c files and MATLAB scripts I used to come up with the filter can also be found in this repo
